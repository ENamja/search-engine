Rather than bring people into a laboratory, I view the real world as a living laboratory--I go where people live, study, and work, to study them as they go about their normal activities. Digital media use affects people\u2019s mood, stress, and behavior quite significantly. In particular, people experience disruptions when working with digital media due to multi-tasking and interruptions. We have studied people in domains ranging from information workers in the workplace to college students in their academic life. We use an array of sensors to measure behavior: stress, mood, focus, interaction, and computer and phone activity. We are exploring how IT can support information organization in a way consistent with a more natural way of organizing work, in terms of thematically connected units of work, or what we term working spheres. \n\nSome selected publications:\n\nMultitasking in the Digital Age, Morgan Claypool (2015).
